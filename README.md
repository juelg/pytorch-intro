# PyTorch Introduction with Exercises and Additional Theory on Weight Initialization and Optimizers for Deep Neural Networks
This repo contains a [presentation](pytorch_intro.ipynb) in form of a jupyter notebook which introduces the core concepts of PyTorch as of mid 2022. It assumes some base knowledge in back propagation.
Furthermore, the repo also includes pytorch [exercises](pytorch_exercise.ipynb) with [solutions](pytorch_exercise_solution.ipynb) to directly apply the learned knowledge. Last but not least, there is an [additional slides](deep_dive_into_weight_initialization_and_optimizers.pdf) set which dives into the theory of weight initialization and optimizers for deep neural networks.
